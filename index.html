	<h1>A little bit about some dances</h1>                                      <a href="Francais.html">FRANCAIS</a>
	<p> I will talk to you about different types of dances that exists today.  Some of which, you probably know, and some of them, than you may not know. Hope that you'll enjoy my passion for dancing.</p>

	<h2>Lets start with a very classic dance:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><h3>Pointe Ballet or Classical Ballet</h3>
			<p>This is probably the best knowned type of dance. Dancers wear tights, pointe shoes, often wearing tutus. You have to be graceful, very flexible and strong.<br>

			<br>
		 But dancers start by learning the basics, on what we call "half-pointe ballet shoes". Wearing those shoes, they learn the proper techniques and movements of the dance, strenghtening their calves and ankles so they won't hurt themselves once on pointe shoes, because ankles injuries are frequent.<br>

		 		 	</li><li><h3>Aerial dance, which is divided in many categories, but lets stick to 2.
		 		 		<br>

		 		 		<p></p><li><h5>1-Aerial silk dance</h5>

		 		 			This is also part of some circus show (Cirque du Soleil as an example). You mustly need strong abs, and strong arms to perform that art.  And no motion sickness.<br>

		 		 			<br><br>
		 		 			</li><li><h5>2-Aerial hoop dance</h5>
		 		 			
		 		 			It's kind of the same, except, that instead of using a silk long fabric, you use a hoola hup, Which is harder on the body!
		 		 			<br>
